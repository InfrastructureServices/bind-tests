Description: Test for bz441495 (No reason for bind binaries to be protected)
Author: Martin Cermak <mcermak@redhat.com>
Bug summary: No reason for bind binaries to be protected
Bugzilla link: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=441495

Description:

This test is a port of original written by psklenar to RHEL6

I set up a new RHEL 5 nameserver today, and the named user is unable to use rndc
(despite having permission to read the rndc.conf/rndc.key files).  I realized
that the rndc binary (and all of the other binaries from the bind RPM) are only
readable by root.

There is no reason for this protection, as none of the binaries are
setuid/setgid or contain private information (especially since anyone could
build their own copy of bind, even from the RHEL SRPM, to get the same rndc
functionality).  This permission setting just means that access cannot be
delegated, which is actually less secure (as now more system operation can only
be done as root).

This is also an issue with the Fedora bind RPM, although there some (but not
all) binaries have been changed to world-readable/executable (see BZ 200465 and
BZ 427826 for example).

Description of test (psklenar):

- all executables in bind packages (yum list |grep '^bind', caching-nameserver)
  should be readable/executable by others - check it.
- also check that configuration files (/etc/named*, /etc/rndc.*, /var/named/*
  subtree) are non-readable by others
- don't neglect this step, it is important to have config files hidden! (I might
  omit something, it's unlikely but might happen)
