Author: Martin Cermak <mcermak@redhat.com>
Bug summary: bind-sdb fails startup if db not running
Bugzilla link: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=533229

<NOTE>

NEW: you can use /CoreOS/bind/Regression/bz533229-bind-sdb-postgresql to set up
the situation. Just the restart stuff was left for manual testing:

You have to terminate the script before the cleanup phase. chkconfig postgresql
and named services on, restart and perform the testing with dig manually.

/CoreOS/bind/Regression/bz533229-bind-sdb-postgresql is rather a sanity test
for bind-sdb itself.
