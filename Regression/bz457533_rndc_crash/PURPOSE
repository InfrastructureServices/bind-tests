Bug summary: named crashes on incorrect usage of rndc reload command
Bugzilla link: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=457533

Description
---------------

Description of problem:
named crashes (process terminates) on incorrect usage of the rndc reload 
command

How To Test
---------------
 - configure zone foo 
 - run rndc reload asd.foo - named crashed (see system log
 - exiting (due to assertion failure)) 


THE BUG SYMPTOMS ;-)
--------------------------

If the bug is present (like in bind-9.2.4-30.el4_8.4), then this line:

rlRun "rndc reload asdfXXX.pokus.cz" 0-255

causes the fail which is finally detected by the next 

rlRun "dig @localhost +short petra.pokus.cz | grep \"192.168.55.55\""

which fails. That's it.


NOTE to the rndc | cat
-------------------------
This is a workaround that should prevent us from AVC denials on RHEL4.
