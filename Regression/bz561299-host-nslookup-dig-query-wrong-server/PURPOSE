Description: Test for bz561299 (host/nslookup/dig query wrong server)
Author: Martin Cermak <mcermak@redhat.com>
Bug summary: host/nslookup/dig query wrong server
Bugzilla link: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=561299

In the unpatched version, if we issue this command: nslookup
<some-existing-fqdn> <some-unexisting-dns-server> then we get correct IP
address of the <some-existing-fqdn> which is wrong. With the patched version we
get  "no servers could be reached", which is OK.

Fixed in RHEL5.6+
